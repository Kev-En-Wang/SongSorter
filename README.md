# SongSorter
Java 2 Final Project
Made by Kevin Wang 2022
This song sorter was made as a final project for my Java 2 course
This used JavaFX for the GUI and the GUI was made through SceneBuilder

Utilities:
Add, Delete and Edit entries that're saved everytime the user does something
Has some detection for bad user inputs, although testing for this wasn't thorough
Has File I/O
In order to challenge myself, I added a "mood" value which is essentially an integer array that determines mood.
Rather friendly UI, didn't idiot proof it because I couldn't find an idiot.

Things I've learned:
JavaFX GUI
Very rudimentary idea of a database
File IO
